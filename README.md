TP Data tools scraping IMDB

This project resume our work that we had to to for a project in our Data Tools class
The purpose of this porject was to learn how to extract and use the data from a HTML format. We decided to work on the IMDB webite, this site is a reference in the moovie sector.
https://www.imdb.com
We decided to work on the top 250 rated moovie section.
Our main type of Data collected from this section was :
- Date of publication
- Rating of the moovie
- Duration of the moovie
- The type of the moovie
- The actors that played in the moovie
- The realisator
- The moovie metascore

You will see some beautifull visualisation of each type of Data
You willget an idea of what can be the next big moovie !!
