# ScrapingIMDB
## TP Data tools scraping IMDB

This project resume our work that we had to do for a project in our Data Tools class.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to extract and use the data from a HTML format.

Our goal was to predict what can be the best rated moovie in the world.

We decided to collect data from the IMDB website : https://www.imdb.com

We decided to work on the top 250 rated moovie section.

## Our main types of Data collected was :
- Date of publication
- Rating of the moovie
- Duration of the moovie
- The type of the moovie
- The actors that played in the moovie
- The realisator
- The moovie metascore
- The most popular words in the story lines

You will see some beautiful visualisation of each type of Data
